								Xmplfy is more than an esports organization; we
								are dedicated to our players and our nation. We,
								as an organization, put our players and creators
								first while supporting where we are from; we
								embrace North America as part of us, and we are
								here to stay, hoping to provide and create the
								North American stars we have seen before! From
								the start of this organization, we had North
								America in our site, and we, as an organization,
								will help our players grow inside and outside of
								the game, building up their brand as well. We
								love esports, but we do know the hardships that
								happen when you reach a certain level. xmplfy is
								here to mentor and provide support to North
								American players and content creators as we
								create unique shows to entertain while keeping
								our eyes on tournaments and leagues for our
								teams!
								<br></br>
								<br></br>
								We aren't your regular organization; we make
								sure everyone of our players, content creators,
								designers, editors, and staff is treated like
								family. As we grow, we often ask what we want it
								to look like. We love the opportunities we have
								to work with some of North America's rising
								stars, and we will always feel like they are
								part of our family we have here at xmplfy. We
								will always have our family's backs, which means
								we will make sure that they get the best!
								<br></br>
								<br></br>
								As we embark on our journey into 2024, there
								will be a lot more opportunities that come our
								way. We are driven to help and pave the way for
								NA! We will be part of North America's growth
								and want to keep these roots strong. We are
								North America. We are Xmplfy!Â
